## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`gc doctor` now checks for binary divergence** — the case where the `gc`
  a probe verifies is not the `gc` the supervisor is executing. The new
  `binary-divergence` check reads the running supervisor's executed image from
  the process itself (`/proc/<pid>/exe` on Linux, `lsof` mapped-text entries on
  macOS) rather than from the path its service unit names, and compares the two
  by **file identity** — device and inode — never by path string. Several paths
  symlinked or hardlinked to one artifact pass, as do two byte-identical
  copies. Genuinely different binaries warn, naming both paths, both versions,
  both modification times and which side is newer, so an operator can tell
  whether they are verifying ahead of or behind the running fleet. A binary
  replaced in place under a running supervisor warns too: the process keeps
  executing the old inode while its reported path is unchanged, which Linux
  marks `(deleted)` and macOS does not mark at all. Without this check, a
  capability probe run from a shell can report a feature present while the
  fleet runs a build that lacks it, or the reverse.

  Every step that cannot obtain an answer says so rather than reaching a
  verdict: a stat that failed, a binary that cannot be read, a platform with no
  route to a process image, a PATH lookup that did not resolve, and a
  supervisor liveness probe whose control socket did not answer all report
  "binary divergence unverified" — never a divergence, and never a green
  check. A green check means a comparison actually ran.

### Fixed

- **`gc doctor`'s `deploy-provenance` check can assert provenance again.** It
  read the running binary's revision from `debug.ReadBuildInfo`'s
  `vcs.revision` only. Since `-buildvcs=false` reached the `build` target on
  2026-08-07 — `artifact` had it already, both because the Go toolchain
  identifies a repository by a `.git` *directory* and so stamps whichever
  repository *encloses* a linked worktree rather than the worktree being
  compiled — no `gc` this repo produces carries that setting. Every run of the
  check therefore reported "provenance not asserted" and silently retired the
  lineage assertion its own documentation calls the load-bearing half: the one
  that catches a deploy built from a stray or rebased-away branch, which a
  "running == on-disk" comparison passes when both are stale. The check now
  falls back to the revision the linker injected (`-X main.commit`), which is
  the revision those builds actually carry, and `cmd/gc` passes it in.
  Precedence goes to the toolchain's stamp when one exists (a `go install`
  build), since it is derived from the repository the build read rather than
  from a value a Makefile passed on the command line.

  Two stamps that name no commit are no longer treated as if they did. The
  `unknown` placeholder a binary carries when nothing was injected degrades to
  "provenance not asserted" rather than being compared against a manifest and
  reported as a stale or clobbered binary. A `-dirty` stamp — what `make build`
  writes from a modified tree — has the suffix stripped before comparison,
  since no git revision carries it, and reports a warning rather than a green:
  the commit is in the lineage, but the deployed bytes are not that commit.

### Changed

- **`make install` no longer writes `~/.local/bin/gc`.** Installing wrote the
  binary to `$(go env GOPATH)/bin/gc` and then relinked `~/.local/bin/gc` at
  it. A deployment writes a real binary to that same path — a release install,
  or a provenance-named `make artifact` build. Two writers, producing
  different *kinds* of file, neither recording that it ran nor warning that it
  was clobbering the other — so a `make install` from any checkout silently
  moved a running deployment onto a dev build, and the machine went on
  executing a stale image for an unknown period with nothing saying so.
  `install` now writes exactly one path and touches no other.

  Moving a deployment onto a build is the new `make deploy-fleet`. It takes
  `GC_DEPLOY_BINARY` (default: what `make install` just wrote) and repoints
  every channel in `GC_DEPLOY_CHANNELS` — `~/.local/bin/gc`,
  `$(go env GOPATH)/bin/gc`, and `~/.gc/bin/gc` — at one resolved artifact.
  Those three shadow each other on `PATH` and the winner differs per execution
  context, so repointing only some of them re-splits which build a shell, an
  agent hook, and the supervisor each run. On the fleet host the `PATH` winner
  is `~/.gc/bin/gc`, not `~/.local/bin/gc` — this is the collapse voxist-city
  ADR-0027 designed, made repeatable. It symlinks rather than copies, refuses
  to move anything until the binary has proved it runs, swaps each channel
  atomically (a temp symlink renamed into place, because `ln -sf` unlinks then
  creates and leaves a window where a live `gc` lookup gets ENOENT), **runs
  every channel afterwards** — `readlink` can only confirm the value just
  written — clears and restores a `uchg` immutable pin under a `trap` instead
  of letting the write fail silently, skips channels whose directory is absent,
  errors rather than reporting success if it moved nothing at all, and leaves a
  channel alone when it already *is* the build, decided by device and inode
  rather than by comparing path text.

  `$(go env GOPATH)/bin/gc` is itself a deploy channel, so on a deployed host it
  is often a symlink at an artifact elsewhere. **`make install` now fails closed
  on that state** rather than warning about it — a warning can only print once
  the channel has already moved, and "nobody noticed" is the failure this
  prevents. Override deliberately with `GC_ALLOW_CHANNEL_OVERWRITE=1`, or
  redirect with `INSTALL_DIR=<dir>`. A symlink pointing *inside* that directory
  is a local convenience, not a deployment, and does not trip the gate.

  Upgrading: `make install` alone no longer updates a running deployment. Add
  `make deploy-fleet` (then restart the supervisor — a running process keeps
  executing the image it started with). Installing still replaces
  `$(go env GOPATH)/bin/gc` itself, so `make install` re-splits the channels
  until `make deploy-fleet` runs — the two are a pair, deliberately not chained.

- **`gc pack registry publish` now refuses an unscoped pack name unless you
  pass `--allow-unscoped-name`.** Registry pack names are scoped as
  `<github-owner>/<pack>`, and the registry has always reserved bare names for
  packs it already holds a claim for — but the CLI submitted one anyway, so the
  refusal arrived only after the request had been created and parked in the
  review queue as an unapprovable pending row. Publish now checks the name
  locally, before any credential or publish traffic, and names the exact
  `[pack].name` edit that fixes it. It also refuses a scope that is not the
  lowercased GitHub owner of the source repository, which the registry rejects
  with no override.

  Upgrading: a publisher of a grandfathered bare name must add
  `--allow-unscoped-name` to keep publishing under it — the registry still
  accepts a bare name it already holds a claim for, and a local preflight
  cannot see the claim table. New packs must set
  `[pack].name = "<github-owner>/<pack>"` in `pack.toml`. `--name` no longer
  stands in for a missing `[pack].name`, and it can no longer rename a pack at
  publish time: the registry byte-compares it with `[pack].name`, so it can
  only restate the name `pack.toml` already declares.

- **`gc bd` now refuses a `--metadata` body it cannot validate before the
  write, on `new` as well as `create` and `update`.** `gc bd` validates
  rig-qualified metadata (`lease_owner`, `routed_to`) ahead of the write so a
  create naming a rig this city does not configure is stopped before it mints a
  stranded bead. That guard admitted `create` and `update` but not `new` — the
  alias `bd` itself registers for `create` — so the same command spelled `gc bd
  new` skipped validation entirely. It now normalizes the alias and applies the
  identical check.

  Upgrading: `gc bd new --metadata @file.json` now exits 1, on every city,
  split or not. The `@file.json` spelling states its object in a file rather
  than in argv, so `gc bd` cannot read the rig qualification before `bd`
  resolves the file and mints from it — the one spelling where a refusal is the
  only fail-closed answer. Pass the JSON inline (`--metadata '{"routed_to":
  "rig/agent"}'`) instead. A malformed inline body is likewise refused by name
  rather than forwarded. No in-repo caller uses the `@file.json` spelling.

### Fixed

- **A control bead served by a relocated class binding is routed to the
  dispatcher its own `gc.root_store_ref` names.** On a split city every rig's
  control beads live in one class binding. The reconciler dropped rig-rooted
  rows from control-dispatcher demand entirely, because a binding's ref reads
  as city scope and the candidate filter required a rig match; and it
  suppressed city-rooted rows from that same demand, because the route repair
  read the binding's ref (`class:gmnos`) as a rig name, found no dispatcher
  for that pseudo-scope, and logged `no configured control-dispatcher for its
  store scope` once per tick. The binding is now collected for every row it
  serves, and the repair keys the dispatcher on the row's root scope, so rig
  rows keep (or are repaired toward) their rig dispatcher and city rows their
  city dispatcher. The diagnostic names the binding and the owning scope.
  Supersedes #5548 and #5588; fixes #5547 and #5587.

- **Mail archive and delete now expand whitespace-joined message IDs.** Each
  positional argument is split into individual IDs before single-versus-batch
  dispatch, so shell variables containing multiple IDs no longer look like one
  already-handled message.

- **`gc import add` of a local in-git pack now locks to HEAD, not the repo's
  latest tag.** Per `gc import add --help`, a local path inside a git
  worktree is documented to be "locked to the current commit," but the
  default version resolution (absent an explicit `--version`) preferred the
  repo's latest semver tag whenever one existed. A pack added to the
  worktree after the last tag was cut resolved to a checkout whose tree
  predates the pack, failing with a misleading "missing pack.toml" error
  even though the pack exists at HEAD. A local-worktree-promoted source now
  always locks to `sha:<HEAD commit>`, matching the documented behavior;
  registry/remote sources are unaffected. Fixes #3659.

- **`gc doctor`'s `order-firing-current` check no longer hard-fails
  `gc doctor` (exit code, `BlockingFailed`) when its own order-history
  lookup times out.** The check races a Dolt-backed order-history query
  against a 15s budget; on timeout it returned `StatusError` with no
  `Severity` set, silently defaulting to `SeverityBlocking` (the zero
  value of `CheckSeverity`) — turning a slow-but-healthy city's doctor run
  red even when scheduled orders were firing normally, since a timed-out
  lookup proves nothing about actual order staleness. The timeout branch
  now explicitly sets `Severity: SeverityAdvisory` and `TimedOut: true`,
  matching how `Doctor.boundedRun`'s own per-check timeout is already
  reported, so callers (including `--json` output) can distinguish
  "confirmed stale" from "the query didn't finish in time." (#4895)

- **Wisp GC now reaps rootless leaf plain-task wisps.** The orphan reaper
  (`reapOrphanedClosedWisps`) previously skipped any closed wisp-tier row
  with no `gc.root_bead_id` pointer outright, and the root-rooted closure
  purge never enumerated it either (it matches none of the root selectors:
  not a molecule, not `gc.kind=wisp`, not a graph.v2 workflow). A closed
  plain-task wisp that never had an owning root therefore accumulated
  uncollected in the wisp tier indefinitely. Such a row now reaps on its
  own closed status when it is a leaf — no parent and no children — since
  it then has no root to check for collectibility and the single-bead
  delete strands nothing. Leaf-ness is tested over both ownership links a
  bead can carry — the `parent_id` column and a `parent-child` dep row —
  since some step beads are joined to their parent by the dep row alone.
  A rootless row that owns a subtree, is itself a subtree member, or is
  not a plain task, remains out of scope, preserving the original safety
  boundary. The leaf-ness probes are bounded per sweep (including in the
  dry-run default, where they are the only backend cost) so the scan never
  does unbounded reads per tick. Fixes #3780.

- **The legacy workspace-identity deprecation warning now caveats that
  following it can silently break packs pinned to an older revision.**
  `city.toml`'s `workspace.name`/`workspace.prefix` deprecation hint told
  operators to move those fields to `.gc/site.toml`, but any installed pack
  still pinned to a revision that reads `workspace.name` directly (rather
  than the newer site-binding-aware resolution) would silently lose its
  identity/routing once the field was removed — reported after one
  deployment lost inbound Discord messages for ~2 days with zero alarms
  before anyone checked delivery receipts. The warning now says so
  explicitly, naming `gc doctor --fix` (which performs the removal) so
  operators check pack compatibility before running it. (#3887)

- **The dashboard's bead dependency graph preserves relation type on inverse
  ("Blocks") edges instead of collapsing every downstream relation to a
  plain, untyped blocker.** `buildBeadGraph`'s inverse-edge pass previously
  stored only the raw dependent bead, discarding the `dependencies[].type`
  (or `needs`) that produced the forward edge; the `BeadDependencies` detail
  view then rendered every downstream relation — `tracks`, `parent-child`,
  or a genuine `blocks` need alike — under the same unlabeled "Blocks"
  heading. A `tracks` relation (e.g. a workflow root tracking a finalizer)
  could therefore read as a second hard dependency. The inverse edge now
  carries the same `kind` as its forward counterpart, and the detail view
  labels it the same way the "Needs" section already labels non-`needs`
  forward edges. (gascity#4365)

- **A named (on-demand) session no longer replays a trigger stamp for a work
  bead that has since been parked.** The pool session path already clears
  `gc.trigger_bead_id` when there is no ready work to route
  (`bindPoolSessionTriggerBead`), but the named path only ever read and
  replayed whatever was already stamped, with no equivalent check. A
  singleton tier re-materializing after its dispatched bead was parked kept
  re-aiming every new seat at the same stale target — one reported case
  produced 16 seats on a single parked bead over ~19 hours, each re-deriving
  the same dead-end analysis. The named path now checks the stamped target's
  live state before resolving its template and clears the stamp (and its
  dependent `gc.brain_parent_sid`) when the target is no longer workable,
  mirroring the pool path's clear semantics. "No longer workable" means
  closed, absent, or dependency-blocked; the blocked case is read off bd's
  `is_blocked` ready-work projection, because every production store folds
  bd's raw `blocked` status into `open`. A target in a store that does not
  publish that projection is left stamped rather than risk a wrong clear, as
  are cross-store targets this reconciler tick cannot reach. (gascity#4373)

- **The work-record close gate now resolves `gc.work_branch` against its
  remote-tracking ref, not the local branch alone.** `gitCommitReachableOnBranch`
  passed the bare branch name (e.g. `main`) straight to
  `git merge-base --is-ancestor`; gitrevisions precedence resolves a bare name
  to the local `refs/heads/<branch>` ahead of any remote-tracking ref. In a
  refinery/polecat topology, merges land via a push from a *different*
  worktree — advancing `refs/remotes/origin/<branch>` but never the local ref
  checked out elsewhere — so a genuinely-landed commit read as unreachable
  until something happened to fast-forward the local branch, which in that
  topology may be never. The gate now checks `refs/remotes/origin/<branch>`
  first when it resolves, and still falls back to the bare branch name — so a
  commit is reachable if it is on either ref. Purely local repos with no
  `origin` remote are unaffected, and a commit that has been committed locally
  but not yet pushed continues to satisfy the gate as it did before.
  (gascity#5037)

### Upgrading Notes

- `session_setup` and `pre_start` entries are now validated as Go templates
  at config load. An entry that carries literal braces for another tool
  (`docker ps --format '{{.Names}}'`, `kubectl -o go-template`, `gh
  --template`) previously ran verbatim and is now rejected; escape the
  opening braces as `{{"{{"}}` (for example `'{{"{{"}}.Names}}'`).

### Added

- **Managed Dolt starts now arm a bounded delivery-drain window before the
  swarm-facing server binds (ADR-0064 D1/D2/AC3).** Every publishing managed
  start — both `gc dolt-state start-managed` and `gc-beads-bd.sh`'s on-demand
  cold start funnel through the same Go choke point — now starts a nested
  managed server on the same data dir with `read_timeout_millis` raised (10m
  default) and `publish=false`, so the runtime state that admits the swarm is
  never written for it and the city stays quiesced by construction. It runs
  the verified-zero `gc dolt sync --drain` (vp-p8tze) against that nested
  server, stops it to release the data-dir lock, then lets the normal start
  proceed at the managed 15s default — closing the gap where four supervised
  hand-run drain windows (2026-07-30 … 2026-08-06) each worked and each was
  undone by the next restart. The window is bounded by an overall budget
  (`GC_DOLT_DELIVERY_WINDOW_BUDGET`, default 5m) so a slow drain cannot stall
  the first `bd` call after a restart indefinitely, and a failed or skipped
  window never blocks the server from starting — it reports a loud
  `MANAGED DOLT DELIVERY WINDOW …` stderr record, including from the
  `gc`-less shell fallback start, which cannot run the window at all, **and**
  persists a `dolt-delivery-window-outcome.json` record in the dolt pack's
  state dir that survives the starting process exiting — stderr alone proved
  invisible in production for the sibling boot-drain path (vp-5mc4p). Disable
  with `GC_DOLT_DELIVERY_WINDOW=0`. (vp-o52ia, ADR-0064)

### Fixed

- **Session command templates fail closed instead of running unexpanded.**
  A `session_setup` or `pre_start` template that failed to parse or expand
  used to reach sh verbatim, so `worktree-setup.sh` received a literal
  `{{.AgentBase}}` and minted a git worktree at `.gc/agents/{{.AgentBase}}`.
  Now such a template is rejected at config load (`gc start` / reload /
  doctor / supervisor restart) with the list of available placeholders; like
  every other agent validation error this refuses the whole city, including
  for a template that arrives through an imported pack. Validation expands
  against sample contexts (one-character values, with and without a rig), so
  a placeholder reachable only behind a comparison neither sample satisfies
  is still caught at session start, where the agent is skipped for that
  tick. `session_live` is cosmetic: a bad entry is a non-fatal load-time
  warning (also under strict mode and in supervisor-managed loads) and is
  skipped at session start, leaving its neighbours in place. The provider launch command keeps
  its raw-command behaviour (now with a warning), since it is assembled at
  resolve time and is where braces meant for another tool usually live. The
  example `worktree-setup.sh` scripts also refuse unexpanded or shifted
  arguments. (ga-iwz7u; the `work_query`/`scale_check`/`on_boot`/`on_death`
  expander and the pack-command script expander keep their raw-command
  fallback, tracked as ga-a85qk.)

- **Runtime-provider waiver expiries are now independent per entry instead of
  sharing one hardcoded date.** All nine `runtime.Provider` contract waivers
  in `internal/testutil/providerledger` previously expired on the same
  literal date, so when that date passed they all lapsed simultaneously and
  took `CI / required` red repo-wide with no code change involved. Two of
  the nine (`acp.NewSeamBacked`, `subprocess.NewSeamBacked`) now carry real
  conformance proofs instead of waivers; the remaining seven each carry
  their own staggered expiry and reference a resolvable owner bead
  (`vp-8eqrh`) instead of an ID that doesn't resolve in this fork's `bd`
  store, so a future lapse degrades one entry instead of the whole merge
  queue.

- **The dolt pack's `run_bounded` python3 fallback now sends SIGTERM before
  SIGKILL, matching its documented contract.** The fallback (used when
  neither `timeout` nor `gtimeout` is on `PATH`, the default on stock macOS)
  previously called `subprocess.run(..., timeout=...)`, which kills the
  child with SIGKILL immediately on expiry — giving it no chance to run its
  own signal handler, unlike the `timeout --kill-after=2` path it's meant to
  match. `mol-dog-backup.sh` wraps `dolt backup sync` in this helper, and
  `dolt` publishes a backup archive under its final name before writing the
  manifest that references it; a SIGKILL mid-sync left the archive
  permanently unreferenced (`dolt backup` has no prune verb). The fallback
  now uses `Popen` + `terminate()` + a 2s grace `wait()` + `kill()`,
  streaming output instead of buffering it. (gascity#4823)

- **`GET /runs/{id}/steps` returns steps in topological (pipeline) order, not
  arbitrary fold order.** No level of the read chain — the handler, the
  member-bead projection, or the run projection fold — applied any sort, so
  the Runs dashboard's Formula Graph rendered a run's steps in whatever order
  the projection happened to yield, unreadable as a pipeline. Steps are now
  topologically sorted on each member's real dependency edges (`Dependencies`
  and `Needs`), with a deterministic bead-ID tiebreak for independent steps
  and steps carrying no dependency data. (gascity#4699)

- **`check-core-boundary.sh` no longer false-positives on an in-tree Go
  build cache.** The `org_` boundary scan walked the whole working tree
  (`grep -r --exclude-dir=vendor --exclude-dir=testdata`), so any untracked
  in-tree Go module cache tripped false violations on third-party module
  sources — the common case is GitLab CI's canonical
  `$CI_PROJECT_DIR/.cache/go-mod` layout. The scan now runs over
  `git ls-files` instead, so an untracked cache or build-artifact directory
  is invisible to it regardless of name, while vendor/testdata (tracked or
  not) stay excluded as before. (gascity#4479)

- **`gc status` no longer pays a full event-log scan for a cosmetic field.**
  `storehealth.LastMaintenance` now prefers the `TailProvider` backward-scan
  fast path over an unbounded forward `List` when the provider supports it,
  and a new `Filter.MaxScanBytes` bounds that backward scan so a rare or
  never-emitted event type (the common case: a city that has never run store
  maintenance) can no longer force a full-file walk just to populate the
  `Last GC:` status line. Previously this cost two full scans of
  `events.jsonl` on every `gc status` call, dominating latency on large event
  logs and surfacing as a spurious "runtime status probe timed out" warning.

  Operator note: `Last GC:` may now be absent on a busy city even though
  maintenance has run. The tail scan looks back a bounded 8 MiB, and it reads
  only the active `events.jsonl` — never the rotated `.gz` archives — so a
  maintenance event that has aged out of the window, or out of the active file
  entirely, is reported as absent rather than stale. The field is display-only
  and nothing gates on it. `gc maintenance status` is the fallback, with one
  caveat: it reads the supervisor's in-memory run history, so it requires a
  running supervisor and resets when the supervisor restarts. It is a live
  view, not an equivalent durable source; for durable history, query the event
  log for `store.maintenance.*` directly. (gascity#4418)

- **`gc formula cook --attach`'s help text no longer claims a parent-child
  relationship it never creates.** `--attach=<bead-id>` has only ever added
  a `blocks` dependency from the attached bead to the sub-DAG root
  (`ensureFormulaCookAttachDep` / `molecule.Attach` both call
  `store.DepAdd(..., "blocks")`, never setting `ParentID`), but the long
  help described it as creating the sub-DAG "as children of the given
  bead." Since convoy auto-close watches parent-child children, not
  `blocks` dependents, a user following the old description would wrongly
  expect an attached sub-DAG's completion to trigger the attached convoy's
  auto-close — it never does. Help text now describes the actual `blocks`
  -only relationship and says so explicitly (gastownhall/gascity#2392).

- **`gc stop --help` and `gc stop --json` now state what actually happens to
  a supervisor-managed city's registration.** `gc stop` has always
  unregistered a supervisor-managed city as part of stopping it, but neither
  the CLI help nor the `--json` output said so — a user reading "Stop all
  agent sessions in the city" reasonably expected `gc start` to find the
  city again later. Help text now documents the unregister behavior and
  points at `gc register`/`gc unregister` for the split operations; the
  `--json` envelope gained an `unregistered` field reporting whether this
  stop also removed the supervisor registration (gastownhall/gascity#4366).

- **`gc bd` no longer lets bd's own error message steer operators into a
  Dolt-server conflict.** When the managed Dolt server is unreachable, bd
  (with `dolt.auto-start: false`, which gc always sets) tells the operator
  to run `bd dolt start` — but that starts a second, unmanaged Dolt server
  that fights gc's own managed server for the same data directory. `gc bd`
  now detects that suggestion in bd's stderr and appends a corrective hint
  pointing at the actual remedy (`gc start` / `gc dolt restart`) alongside
  bd's original output, without altering bd's own exit code. The hint fires
  only for gc-managed Dolt endpoints, whose lifecycle gc owns; externally
  bound or explicitly configured endpoints keep bd's own output unchanged
  (gastownhall/gascity#1374).

- **ACP activity is now available across process boundaries.** ACP
  `session/update` timestamps are published through an atomic, coalesced
  sidecar, allowing a process other than the session owner to report
  `last_active`. Sidecar I/O runs off the JSON-RPC dispatch loop, and transient
  publication failures are reported and retried. ACP now declares the matching
  activity capability, enabling timed idle policies and the existing opt-in
  `[session] progress_stall_timeout` policy. The declaration also engages two
  paths that are on by default for ACP: a configured named ACP session whose
  config has drifted is no longer deferred as `activity_unknown`, so a
  config-drift tick can now reset it once its last observed activity is older
  than the two-minute named-session activity threshold; and nudge delivery now
  applies the configured quiescence window to ACP instead of taking the
  deliver-without-an-activity-signal fast path. Activity age records only the last
  observed protocol update; it does not by itself diagnose why updates stopped
  or prove that a session is dead. `progress_stall_timeout` remains disabled by
  default.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-07-24

### Upgrading Notes

- **Configure one store-scoped `control-dispatcher` for every graph-owning
  scope.** Formula control beads now route to the dispatcher whose `Dir`
  matches the city or rig store that owns the graph. A rig-owned graph with no
  matching dispatcher fails before instantiation instead of falling back to a
  dispatcher that cannot read its work.
- **Run `gc doctor --fix` after upgrading an existing city.** The current
  doctor converges pack imports, provider catalogs, project identity, retired
  hold labels, and managed beads/Dolt metadata before the orchestrator starts.
- **Upgrading over an older install at a different path may need a manual
  reseed.** If a machine already ran an older `gc` (for example a Homebrew
  binary now replaced by a source build at a new path), `gc start` can keep the
  stale supervisor running and can fail closed on a present-but-invalid
  bundled-pack cache — only an *absent* cache self-heals. Run `gc import
  install` to repopulate the cache, then let `gc start` auto-restart the
  supervisor (or on Linux `systemctl --user restart gascity-supervisor`).
- **An unrelated stale registered city can block `gc start`; fix or unregister
  that city — not the one you are starting.** A pre-1.3 city still registered
  with un-migrated provider config (for example `workspace.provider = "claude"`
  with no `[providers.claude]` block) can fail the registry scan and abort
  startup, with a misleading hint to `gc init` the healthy city you were
  actually starting. Run `gc doctor --fix` inside the offending stale city, or
  `gc unregister <stale-city>` to drop it.
- **macOS: a supervisor left running from a prior version may need a manual
  restart.** macOS cannot resolve a direct (non-launchd) supervisor's
  executable for binary-drift detection, so the automatic post-upgrade restart
  may not complete. Run `gc supervisor stop --wait`, then `gc start`.

### Added

- **A run-centered dashboard and API.** Run detail now combines the formula
  stage ladder, structured transcripts, token rate, and estimated burn rate.
  Session and run reads use typed, paginated API surfaces backed by warm
  projections instead of ad hoc wire shapes.
- **Durable usage and lifecycle observability.** Model, compute, and lifecycle
  facts feed local usage history and OpenTelemetry metrics. End-of-interval
  transcript sweeps keep live pool sessions' token and cost rates current even
  when agents self-drive after their initial claim.
- **Privacy-scoped command-usage metrics in release artifacts.** Before the
  first eligible interactive command is recorded, `gc` shows the complete
  disclosure. Events contain only a canonical command ID, the `gc` release,
  operating system, and an anonymous installation ID—never arguments, paths,
  file contents, or environment values. `gc metrics status`, `example`, `on`,
  and `off` expose the local controls; `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` and
  `GC_DISABLE_USAGE_METRICS=1` provide environment-level opt-outs.
- **Broader runtime composition.** Provider routing, ACP/automatic runtime
  selection, Herdr-backed sessions, and Kubernetes/subprocess/tmux execution
  share the same session lifecycle and worker boundary.
- **Production workflow controls.** Formulas v2 gained stronger retry,
  fan-out, drain, scope, artifact, and finalization behavior, plus better live
  status and event evidence for operators.
- **An experimental OpenClaw bridge proof of concept.** The private package
  under `contrib/openclaw-bridge` explores iMessage and Telegram connectors; it
  is not a supported provider pack or a shipped connector artifact.

### Changed

- **Session lifecycle operations converge through the worker boundary.** Pool
  demand, wake, resume, drain, close, and orphan recovery now reason from
  persisted session/work identity rather than provider-specific shortcuts.
- **Beads remains the persistence boundary while storage becomes more
  resilient.** Native and CLI-backed stores share transactional lifecycle
  semantics, bounded cached reads, store-aware routing, and explicit degraded
  results across city and rig scopes.
- **CI and local verification are sharded and event-driven.** The release gate
  includes fast units, process tests, integration packages, tutorials, real
  inference acceptance, and macOS regressions without one monolithic test
  process.

### Fixed

- **`order-firing-current`: bound event reads to the check's own staleness
  horizon, degrade corrupt archives to a visible warning, and close the
  unknown-controller-start fail-open (vc-89s).** The doctor check read every
  `order.fired` event ever recorded (29 archives / 1.3 GB on the reporting
  city) plus a second full-history scan for `controller.started`, and one
  truncated gzip archive hard-failed the whole check for days, masking the
  real verdict. Archive pruning is now time-aware: `archiveOverlapsFilter`
  skips archives whose rotation timestamp predates `Filter.Since` (never
  pruning on `Until` — an archive's first-event time is unrecorded, so that
  would silently drop events). The fired-events read is bounded at the
  callsite by `3 × max(expected interval)`; because the window makes
  `IsZero` ambiguous ("never fired" vs "fired before the window" — and the
  classifier's uptime-grace branch would turn that ambiguity into a
  false green after any recent controller restart, plan vc-89s C9), a
  windowed zero is disambiguated with one newest-first
  `events.ReadLatestMatch` probe, paid only for orders already suspected
  stale; when that history is unreadable the verdict degrades to Warning,
  never OK. `controller.started` —
  too rare for any window — uses the new newest-first, archive-spanning
  `events.ReadLatestMatch`, correct for arbitrarily old starts at O(1
  archive) typical cost. Unreadable archives now degrade to skip-plus-warning
  via `events.ReadFilteredWithWarnings` and surface as **Warning (degraded)**
  naming the skipped file — never `StatusError`, never a silent skip — and
  the untested `never fired (controller start unknown)` path reports
  `StatusWarning` instead of the false-green `StatusOK` on exactly the dead
  orders the check exists to catch.
- **Restore the native beads store fleet-wide: move the linked beads library
  past migration 0054, and stop `version_compat` failing on pseudo-version
  pins (vp-kpoi).** The deployed `bd` binary migrated every store to schema
  v54 while gc's linked `github.com/steveyegge/beads` v1.1.0 tops out at
  migration 0053, so `native_open` refused every rig scope ("database is at
  v54, binary knows up to v53") and every store op silently fell back to the
  exec store — degraded for 6 days at ~130 warns/hour. No published beads tag
  contains 0054, so go.mod now pins the first upstream commit that does:
  `v1.1.1-0.20260704062855-e97839a2e1c0` (an explicitly time-boxed bridge
  until upstream cuts a tag ≥0054). The preflight `version_compat` check now
  treats a pseudo-versioned linked library like a source build: an
  untagged-commit pin carries no release label comparable to bd's
  self-reported version, so the label comparison can neither confirm nor
  refute parity — the schema version (asserted in the same check and again at
  native open) stays the real compatibility signal. Without that carve-out the
  label mismatch (`1.1.0` ≠ `1.1.1-0.20260704…`) would have re-taken the
  native store offline at the `version_compat` gate — the same
  label-vs-schema string-compare defect, one layer up.
- **One unresolvable `[[patches.agent]]` target no longer aborts the city-wide
  config load (vc-quqf; incident vc-9wa, 2026-06-30).** A patch whose
  `{dir, name}` resolves to no agent in the merged config previously failed the
  whole load — every `gc` command (hook/rig/bd-via-gc/scale) died at
  `patches.agent[N] ... not found in merged config`, taking the city down over
  one typo. Composition now emits a warning naming the offending
  `patches.agent[N]` index plus `dir`/`name`, skips that patch, and applies the
  rest; the warning prints on the standard config-load path of every `gc`
  command, so the skipped patch stays visible at runtime. Scope is deliberately agent patches only: malformed entries (empty
  `name`), and typos in `[[patches.rigs]]` / `[[patches.providers]]` /
  `[[patches.named_session]]` / `[[patches.github_pr_monitor]]`, still
  hard-error. `gc config lint` (new, above) reports the warning as a failure so
  the typo still blocks pre-commit.

- **Stop dispatch-budget starvation of short-interval orders: staleness-priority
  admission + config-driven per-tick budget (vp-cixi.6 / PR #77; CHANGELOG and
  derivation added retroactively by vc-wz5.4).** The order dispatcher's fixed
  per-tick budget of 4 degraded every order to one fire per full ring rotation
  on large rings (voxist-city: 122 orders × ~94s ticks ⇒ 30s orders fired every
  33–90 min). `orderAdmissionOrder()` now admits most-overdue-first
  (`elapsed ÷ interval`), which protects short-interval orders at any budget
  size, and the budget is configurable via the new `[orders]
  max_dispatches_per_tick` knob in city.toml (`*int`, nil/≤0 ⇒ default). The
  shipped default of 32 is derived from voxist-city's ~122-order ring
  (Σ over cooldown orders of 1/interval_min + headroom) and is NOT a
  typical-city value; admission forks one subprocess per order with no
  downstream concurrency bound, so the default is due to be re-derived
  conservatively (with voxist-city's operational value moved to its own
  city.toml) before any upstream contribution — capacity-gated follow-up
  tracked in vc-wz5.4.

- **Break the Dolt read-timeout death match: reap idle pooled connections
  client-side before the managed server kills them (vc-wz5.1).** The Go-native
  `internal/doltpool` pool bounded only a connection's total lifetime
  (`connMaxLifetime`, `1h`) with no idle reaping, so an idle pooled connection
  unused past the managed Dolt server's `read_timeout_millis` was closed
  server-side while the client still trusted it for up to an hour. The driver
  then handed the dead conn to the next operation (`closing bad idle connection:
  EOF / connection reset by peer / broken pipe`), taxing every op with a
  dead-conn round trip and — under churn — losing the dispatcher's last-fired
  write, which surfaced as town-wide scheduled-order staleness (vc-wz5). The pool
  now sets `connMaxIdleTime = 10s` (the load-bearing guard: below both the 15s
  managed default and a 30s live override, with margin) and lowers
  `connMaxLifetime` to `20s`; the client per-query `readTimeout` is unchanged
  (it is the in-flight response deadline, not the idle-reaping knob). A new
  `dolt-timeout-race` doctor check asserts the client idle-connection ceiling
  (`doltpool.IdleConnCeiling`) stays strictly below the server
  `read_timeout_millis` at runtime — reading the live managed `dolt-config.yaml`
  with a configured-default fallback — turning a previously silent stderr storm
  into a structured, blocking signal.

- **Pin the `beads` dependency to the stable v1.0.4.** v1.3.0 built against
  `beads v1.0.5`, which was subsequently withdrawn (demoted to a pre-release;
  `v1.0.4` is the current stable release). v1.3.1 repins the `beads` Go module
  and the CI `bd` toolchain (`BD_VERSION`) to `v1.0.4`. No behavior change is
  expected — Gas City already defaults to `bd_compatibility = "bd-1.0.4"`
  semantics, and the config still accepts both `bd-1.0.4` and `bd-1.0.5`.
- **Pool sessions no longer lose or strand work while draining, restarting, or
  reusing capacity.** Claim ownership, wake budgets, slot selection, and
  confirmed-dead cleanup are now fenced against stale or partial observations.
- **Formula control routing retries transient configuration reads.** Attempt
  spawn and fan-out no longer quarantine an in-flight run because of a
  momentary config/include read failure; a successfully loaded configuration
  that lacks the required scoped dispatcher still fails closed.
- **Managed beads and Dolt paths fail more honestly.** Provider health,
  endpoint ownership, lock release, compaction, reindexing, stale data-dir
  cleanup, and partial-store reads now preserve errors instead of silently
  reporting complete state.
- **Events, nudges, waits, and session output remain bounded under load.** The
  CLI drains paginated event windows, request paths avoid unbounded scans, tmux
  sessions keep their shared server, and structured transcripts preserve tool
  and error frames.
- **Live run cost fields populate for long-lived pool sessions.**
  End-of-interval model-usage sweeps account for each transcript window once,
  restoring `tokens/min` and `burn/hr` in run detail (PR #4436).
- **Customer Zero dashboard and claim regressions are closed.** Cross-city
  attention reads now cancel stale requests and recover after startup; Health
  reports per-metric availability with cross-platform sampling instead of
  false zero/NaN values; and hook claims no longer fuzzy-update a vanished
  session record (#4354, #4356, #4361).
- **Release-candidate gates are portable and reproducible.** Bash 3 scripts,
  deep metrics fixtures, reusable pool slots, Tier C pack compatibility, and
  container-tool vulnerability checks now exercise the same bounded behavior
  expected from the shipped artifacts.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-18

### Upgrading Notes

- **Run `gc doctor --fix` once per existing city after upgrading.** The 1.3
  doctor owns the breaking migrations for explicit provider catalogs and
  explicit pack imports/locks. The relevant checks are `provider-catalog`,
  `builtin-pack-imports`, and `packv2-import-state`.
- **Provider references must be declared in `[providers]`.** Cities that set
  `workspace.provider` or agent-level `provider` values now need matching
  `[providers.<name>]` entries. `gc doctor --fix` appends missing built-in
  aliases such as `[providers.claude] base = "builtin:claude"`; custom
  providers still require hand-authored provider tables.
- **Built-in and gastown pack composition changed.** Gas City no longer
  relies on implicit built-ins or per-city `.gc/system/packs` materialization.
  Existing `workspace.includes = [".gc/system/packs/..."]`, legacy public
  `gastown`/`maintenance` import sources, superseded bundled pins, and stale
  locks are migrated to explicit pinned imports in `pack.toml` plus
  `packs.lock`.
- **No control-dispatcher named session is generated.** The control dispatcher
  serves entirely via demand-scaling of the core pack's `core.control-dispatcher`
  agent template (controller work routed through `gc.routed_to =
  "core.control-dispatcher"`), so the on-demand `[[named_session]]` alias older
  builds wrote is redundant. `gc init` no longer creates it, and `gc doctor
  --fix` (during a pack-layout migration) drops the stale alias from upgraded
  cities so its "backing template not found … disabled" warning stops firing.
- **Generated configs no longer pin `formula_v2`.** Formula v2 is on by
  default, so `gc init` omits the `[daemon] formula_v2` line instead of writing
  the default value. An explicit `formula_v2 = false` (or the deprecated
  `graph_workflows = false` alias) is still honored and preserved on round-trip.
- **`gc session logs --tail N` no longer renders blank.** Every transcript
  entry that occupies a tail window now prints at least one line — a non-error
  `tool_result` shows `tool_result: ok`, and any otherwise non-rendering entry
  (empty text, thinking, or an unrecognized block) shows `(no displayable
  content)` — so a tail landing on such entries can no longer produce empty
  output.
- **The built-in Claude provider no longer declares a fresh-start
  `session_id_flag`.** Claude remains resume-capable, but Gas City now records
  the provider-created session key after startup instead of passing a
  preselected fresh-session ID.
- **The `gastown` pack is now consumed from
  `github.com/gastownhall/gascity-packs`.** The old checked-in
  `examples/gastown/packs/gastown` tree is gone. Move local customizations
  into an explicitly imported pack instead of editing `.gc/system/packs` or
  the retired vendored example path.
- **Fallback agents were removed.** Packs that previously depended on a
  fallback dog/worker must ship their own worker pool and formulas. Cross-pack
  agent name collisions are now hard errors.
- **Public imports are intentionally small.** Authored `[imports.<binding>]`
  tables expose `source` and optional `version`; older `export`,
  `transitive`, and `shadow` keys remain compatibility-only loader behavior,
  not public schema.
- **Formula v2 targeted executions use `convoy_id`, not `bead_id`.**
  Graph/formula v2 templates no longer receive `{{bead_id}}`; update them to
  use the reserved `{{convoy_id}}` variable for the input convoy. Formula v2
  rejects authored inputs named `convoy_id` or `bead_id`, and `{{issue}}`
  remains only a temporary compatibility alias that should be migrated too.

### Changed

- **Version pins on builtin packs are honored: the binary only pre-seeds
  its embedded content at each pack's canonical pin.** Previously the
  bundled synthetic cache served the running binary's embedded bytes for
  ANY commit pinned on a bundled source — editing the pin changed nothing.
  Now only the canonical pin (the one `gc init` writes) resolves from the
  embedded copy; a bundled source pinned at any other commit behaves
  exactly like a regular remote import: `gc import install` fetches that
  exact commit from git, validation uses the git checkout, and the cache
  slot uses the plain remote key. Cities on canonical pins keep working
  fully offline, including across binary upgrades that keep the pin
  constants; releases that bump a canonical pin migrate existing cities
  via `gc doctor --fix` (superseded canonical pins are rewritten to the
  current one).

- **Builtin packs are no longer materialized into cities; they compose via
  pinned imports resolved from the user-global pack cache.** The per-city
  `.gc/system/packs` tree is retired (and pruned on sight): `gc init` now
  writes pinned `[imports.core]`/`[imports.bd]` entries into pack.toml plus
  a matching packs.lock, and the gc binary self-heals the GC_HOME cache
  (`$GC_HOME/cache/repos`) with its own embedded content so the pins resolve
  offline. The `builtin-pack-includes` doctor check became
  `builtin-pack-imports`: it migrates legacy `workspace.includes =
  [".gc/system/packs/..."]` cities by stripping the includes, upserting the
  pinned imports (creating a minimal pack.toml for legacy cities), and
  refreshing packs.lock and the cache. The bd lifecycle script moved behind
  a stable per-city shim at `.gc/scripts/gc-beads-bd.sh` that execs the
  cache-resolved bundled script; provider normalization still recognizes
  the legacy materialized path. All repo-cache roots (packman install,
  config resolution, doctor) now uniformly resolve via GC_HOME instead of
  mixing `$HOME/.gc` and GC_HOME. `gc rig add --include <builtin>`
  canonicalizes to the bundled remote source and locks it. **Migration:**
  run `gc doctor --fix` once per existing city.

- **The registry `gascity` planning pack is bundled and offered by the init
  wizard.** `gc init` now offers `gascity` as a config template alongside
  minimal/gastown (also via `--template gascity`), wiring the pinned public
  import from gascity-packs the same way the gastown template does. The
  pack is embedded from the `github.com/gastownhall/gascity-packs` module
  root, so the pin resolves offline from the bundled synthetic cache.

- **Managed Dolt servers now enable auto-GC by default.** `auto_gc_behavior.enable`
  is `true` and `dolt_auto_gc_enabled` is `ON` in the generated server config.
  Previously both defaulted to `false`/`OFF`, requiring manual `CALL dolt_gc()`
  runs to reclaim disk space. Set `[dolt] auto_gc_enabled = false` in `city.toml`
  to restore the previous behavior.

- **The bundled gastown pack is now a Go module dependency, not a checked-in
  copy.** `examples/gastown/packs/gastown` is gone; the gc binary embeds the
  pack from `github.com/gastownhall/gascity-packs` (pinned in go.mod to the
  registry release commit), and the example city composes gastown through
  the pinned public registry import plus a committed `packs.lock` — the same
  shape `gc init` writes — resolved offline from the bundled synthetic
  cache. `scripts/update-bundled-gastown-pack` no longer writes a vendored
  tree; it bumps the go.mod pin, the `PublicGastownPack*` constants, and the
  example pins from the latest registry release, and `--check` verifies the
  pinned module content against the registry hash. The gastown integration
  tests in `examples/gastown` now run against the module-embedded bytes, so
  a runtime/pack mismatch fails in gascity CI.

- **The bundled maintenance pack was folded into the core pack, and builtin
  packs compose only through explicit pinned imports.** The bundled `core`
  pack carries the gc-* skills, default worker prompts, core formulas, the
  mechanical housekeeping orders that used to ship in the maintenance pack
  (gate-sweep, orphan-sweep, cross-rig-deps, order-tracking-sweep,
  spawn-storm-detect, prune-branches, wisp-compact, nudge-mail-sweep,
  nudge-on-route, cascade-nudge-on-blocker-close), the check-binaries doctor
  check, and the per-provider hook overlays. Config load no longer splices
  builtin packs into composition: `gc init` writes explicit `[imports.core]`
  and, for default bd-provider cities, `[imports.bd]` entries into
  `pack.toml`, plus a matching `packs.lock`. The fixable
  `builtin-pack-imports` doctor check repairs missing imports and migrates
  legacy `workspace.includes = [".gc/system/packs/..."]` cities by stripping
  those includes, adding the pinned imports, and pruning stale
  `.gc/system/packs` materialization. **Migration:** run `gc doctor --fix`
  once per existing city.
- **The implicit fallback dog is gone, and the `fallback` agent field was
  removed.** The gastown pack now owns its dog pool outright
  (`agents/dog/`, themed, with `mol-shutdown-dance`), and the dolt pack
  keeps its own dolt dog for Dolt maintenance formulas. The
  fallback-agent resolution mechanism (`fallback = true`, non-fallback
  wins, first-loaded wins) was removed: cross-pack agent name collisions
  are now hard errors, and a stale `fallback` key in a V2
  `agents/<name>/agent.toml` is ignored while a V1 inline `[[agent]]`
  entry fails the pack's unknown-key gate. External packs that relied on
  the bundled fallback dog must define their own worker pool (or route
  work to a pool they ship themselves).

### Added

- **`gc provider rotate-key <provider> <newkey>` hot-rotates provider credentials
  without a tmux kill-server.** The command re-sources the new key into the tmux
  server global environment (`SetGlobalEnvironment`) and then pushes it into
  every live session's environment (`SetEnvironment`) — so existing agents pick
  up the new credential on their next API call without a restart. Supports
  `--dry-run` to preview which sessions would be updated. Sessions restored via
  `PRESERVE_SESSIONS` are enumerated by `ListSessions()` and receive the update;
  the only edge case that survives rotation is a session that crashes and is
  restored from tmux resurrection *after* rotate-key runs (a pre-existing
  constraint of the no-kill-server design, noted in `--help`).
- **Early access: the public `gascity-packs` collection.** v1.3.0 ships the
  first early-access release of
  [`gascity-packs`](https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity-packs) — an opt-in
  collection of Gas City packs composed via `pack.toml` `[imports]`. Add one
  with e.g.
  `gc import add --name gc https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity-packs.git//gascity`.
  Featured packs:
  - **`gascity`** — planning & implementation workflow pack; bundled in the
    release and the default `gc init` template (also `--template gascity`).
  - **`gastown`** — multi-agent orchestration / default coding workflow pack;
    bundled and offered by `gc init` (`--template gastown`).
  - **`compound-engineering`** (`compound-build`) — Every Inc.'s Compound
    Engineering methodology as a build factory: brainstorm/plan → persona-panel
    plan review → implement → wide reviewer-persona fanout → resolution.
  - **`gstack`** (`gstack-build`) — garrytan/gstack founder-style sprint:
    office-hours intake → multi-perspective plan review → staff review → QA →
    security → release readiness.
  - **`superpowers`** (`superpowers-build`) — Jesse Vincent's Superpowers skill
    library as a build factory: brainstorm → written-spec approval → per-task
    TDD → spec-compliance then code-quality review.
  `gascity` and `gastown` are in the supported registry; the three
  build-methodology packs (`compound-engineering`, `gstack`, `superpowers`) are
  early access and each import `gascity` as `gc`. See the gascity-packs README
  for the full list and import instructions.

- **Formulas v2 and `drain` are the supported path for new graph
  workflows.** The v2 compiler emits flat workflow graphs with
  controller-owned control/finalize beads, and `drain` is now the canonical
  fan-out primitive for scattering convoy members into per-item formula runs.
  The bundled `gascity` planning pack ships graph.v2 build and implementation
  formulas, including the mayor skill's documented `gc sling ... --on
  <formula>` launch flow and drain-based `implement` workflow, so new Gas City
  methodology workflows no longer need the legacy `gc.output_json`/tally fan-out
  pattern.

- Proxy-process workspace services now receive `GC_SERVICE_SECRETS_DIR`
  (`<GC_SERVICE_STATE_ROOT>/secrets`) in their environment, alongside the
  existing `GC_SERVICE_*` variables. The directory is scaffolded at `0700`
  by the service state-root setup and is the sanctioned home for
  pack-managed credentials (bot tokens etc.), so pack services can rely on
  the explicit contract instead of deriving the path from
  `GC_SERVICE_STATE_ROOT`. See #3429.
- `gc nudge drain --inject` now prepends a one-line current-time stamp
  (operator-local + UTC + epoch) to its `UserPromptSubmit` hook output, giving
  agents a live clock in context every turn. The local zone follows the host
  (`time.Local`/`$TZ`) or the `GC_OPERATOR_TZ` override; disable with
  `GC_INJECT_CLOCK=0`. Folded into the existing nudge inject, so it adds zero
  extra hook subprocesses per turn. See #3036.
- The supervisor now merges a machine-local secrets file
  (`${GC_HOME}/secrets.env`, dotenv syntax) into the launchd plist / systemd
  unit environment on every service-file regeneration. This fixes provider
  credentials being dropped when `gc start` runs from a shell that did not
  export them (e.g. at login or after a reboot), which previously caused
  silent provider auth failures. Only keys already eligible for the supervisor
  environment are merged (provider credentials plus `GC_SUPERVISOR_ENV`
  opt-ins); a value exported in the calling shell still takes precedence, and
  `GC_SUPERVISOR_OMIT_PROVIDER_CREDS=1` suppresses provider credentials from
  both sources.
- `GC_DOLT_SYNC_PUSH_TIMEOUT_SECS` configures the SQL-mode push wall-clock
  ceiling for `gc dolt sync` (default 1800s, replacing the prior fixed 120s
  that SIGKILLed large first pushes). Metadata queries keep their own 120s
  bound.
- **ENOSPC pre-flight for managed Dolt** (`GC_DOLT_MIN_FREE_BYTES`,
  `GC_DOLT_WARN_FREE_BYTES`): managed-Dolt startup and the store-maintenance
  compaction loop now check container free space via `statvfs(2)` before
  performing disk-growing operations. Below the critical floor (default
  500 MiB) startup is refused and compaction is skipped; below the soft floor
  (default 2 GiB) a `gc.store.disk_warn` event is emitted and operations
  proceed. Fails open on probe error and is disabled entirely when
  `GC_DOLT_MIN_FREE_BYTES=0`. Uses `f_bavail` (APFS-safe — excludes purgeable
  space). Addresses the root trigger of the 2026-06-01 fleet-drain incident.

### Fixed

- The synthetic bundled-pack cache key now folds in the running binary's
  embedded-pack content hash, so two `gc` binaries with different bundled-pack
  content resolve to different cache directories instead of fighting over one.
  Previously the cache directory was keyed only on namespace+source+commit, so a
  version-skewed deploy (controller and agents on different `gc` builds) left
  both binaries materializing one shared directory in turn: each `gc import
  install` was promptly clobbered by the other binary, re-wedging every `gc bd`
  citywide with "bundled pack cache content hash does not match current binary"
  roughly hourly. With the content hash in the key, `gc import install` for a
  given binary sticks for that binary regardless of other versions running.
  Note: deploying a binary with changed bundled-pack content still requires a
  one-time `gc import install` (or bootstrap materialize) to populate the new
  cache directory; that install is now durable rather than transient (ga-s9p).

- Pool respawn after `gc runtime drain-ack` no longer waits up to a full patrol
  interval (default 60 s) before the replacement session starts. The async kill
  goroutine now pokes the controller once after the session is gone so Phase 2
  (finalize bead + spawn replacement) runs on the next event tick. Fixes the
  `TestLifecycle_DrainAckResponsiveRespawn/prequeued_respawn_2364` Tier B
  nightly regression (ga-ryhnhd, #2364, #2251).

- `gc dolt sync` now emits per-mode diagnostics on push failure instead of a
  generic "push failed": a TIMEOUT message naming the ceiling and
  `GC_DOLT_SYNC_PUSH_TIMEOUT_SECS` on exit 124, the underlying exit code on
  other failures, and the underlying dolt stderr. The replayed stderr cannot
  leak `GC_DOLT_PASSWORD`: the password reaches dolt via the `DOLT_CLI_PASSWORD`
  environment variable, never as an argv flag. `GC_DOLT_SYNC_PUSH_TIMEOUT_SECS`
  rejects every numeric-zero form (`0`, `00`, `000`, ...) -- not just the
  literal `0` -- because GNU `timeout` treats a zero duration as "disable the
  timeout", which would push unbounded. A failure to create the stderr-capture
  temp file now degrades to a per-database error rather than aborting the whole
  run.
- Interactive `gc session new` tmux sessions now scroll tmux scrollback on the
  mouse wheel instead of leaking the wheel to the focused TUI (Claude Code's own
  history, a pager, or the shell). The gastown pack binds `WheelUpPane`→copy-mode
  and `WheelDownPane`→passthrough, and the runtime resolves interactive sessions
  to mouse-on across every create seam so tmux preserves the `mouse on` set at
  session create: the `gc session new` CLI — both the managed-deferred reconciler
  start (`templateParamsToConfig`, for `session_origin=manual` sessions) and the
  unmanaged direct start (`workerSessionCreateHints`) — plus the API
  provider/named paths (`sessionCreateHints`). Resume keeps mouse-on too
  (`sessionResumeHints`), so the wheel survives suspend/restart. Headless agent
  sessions stay mouse-off (controller-poll safety) — they resolve `MouseOn` from
  the agent template path (`cfgAgent.MouseModeOn()`), which is unchanged and has
  neither the `manual`/`named` interactive marker. Replaces the portharbour
  po-vtg2 city-local `set-hook` stopgap with the in-source fix. Refs: ga-c4w.

### Troubleshooting (packs, imports, registry)

v1.3.0 changed pack composition: built-in/gastown packs are now consumed via
explicit pinned `[imports]` in `pack.toml` + `packs.lock`, served from a
content-hashed cache under `~/.gc/cache/repos/` (nothing is materialized into
`.gc/system/packs` anymore). Most upgrade issues are fixed by one command — run
it once per existing city after upgrading:

```
gc doctor --fix
```

It owns the mechanical migrations (`provider-catalog`, `builtin-pack-imports`,
`packv2-import-state`): it adds missing pinned imports, strips legacy
`workspace.includes` / `[packs]` surfaces, re-pins superseded canonical
versions, refreshes `packs.lock` + cache, and prunes leftover `.gc/system/packs`.

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `does not import required builtin pack(s) core; run "gc doctor --fix"` | City predates explicit `[imports]`. | `gc doctor --fix` |
| `workspace.includes is deprecated in v2; use [imports]` / `[packs] is deprecated` / `unsupported PackV1` | Legacy v1 composition surfaces. | `gc doctor --fix` (a fragment-authored `[packs]` may need a manual edit) |

| `synthetic cache is invalid at <dir>: missing bundled pack cache marker` | Bundled synthetic cache present but invalid (an *absent* cache self-heals offline). | `gc import install` |
| `N bundled import(s) pinned at a superseded canonical version` | Stale `packs.lock` from an older `gc`. | `gc doctor --fix` (offline re-pin) |
| `durable import(s) use command-time registry selectors` | A `registry:` selector was written into `pack.toml`. | Manual edit — replace with the concrete source (`gc pack registry show <pack>`) |
| `gc start` prints `FATAL: pack schema 2 not supported` | A stale supervisor still on the old binary. | let `gc start` auto-restart, or `systemctl --user restart gascity-supervisor` |

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- Built-in pack auto-includes now skip packs already reachable from rig pack
  graphs, preventing duplicate maintenance agents when a rig pack imports a
  built-in pack transitively.
- CI, docs, the managed minimum check, and install helpers now pin Dolt 2.1.0
  so hotfix validation and runtime dependency checks use the same Dolt floor.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- Claude Opus 4.8 is now listed in built-in Claude model choices and default
  pricing. The `opus` model choice targets `claude-opus-4-8`; `opus-4-7`
  remains available for cities that need the prior Opus target. Anthropic's
  published regular-usage pricing is unchanged from Opus 4.7: $5/MTok input
  and $25/MTok output.
- `[daemon].dolt_start_address_in_use_retry_window` configures how long the
  managed dolt start path waits on the originally requested port when bind
  fails with "address already in use" before falling back to a higher port.
  Defaults to `30s`, which roughly covers half of Linux's default TCP
  TIME_WAIT and prevents an external `kill -TERM` / supervisor restart / OOM
  kill of the dolt subprocess from perpetuating a rebound orphan on a
  non-canonical port. Each port gets at most one wait per
  `startManagedDoltProcessWithOptions` invocation, so the worst-case wall
  time per startup is bounded by `(retry_window + per-attempt-startup) ×
  min(5, distinct-ports-tried)` rather than `retry_window × 5`. Set to `0s`
  to disable the retry (legacy fall-back-immediately behavior). Operators
  with a recovery-latency monitor may want to raise their alert threshold
  by ~30s to absorb the new wait under contended port conditions; the
  worst-case per startup remains well under one minute at defaults.
  During a same-port retry the managed-dolt state file briefly reports
  `Running:false, PID:0` for up to `retry_window` while the wait elapses;
  state-readers (`gc dolt-state status`, rig endpoint port projection,
  order routing) treat this as transient not-running and recover on the
  next successful bind. The provider-op timeout for `start` remains `120s`;
  an operator who raises `dolt_start_address_in_use_retry_window` materially
  above the default should also raise that timeout to keep headroom for the
  5-attempt cap.
- `[daemon].dolt_stop_timeout` typos are now caught by `ValidateDurations`
  at config load (previously only `ValidateNonNegativeDurations` covered it,
  so an invalid string like `"30sec"` silently collapsed to zero).

### Fixed

- `gc mail reply` and `gc handoff` now store created mail in the wisp tier,
  matching `gc mail send`. Operators should use `gc mail` commands or
  explicit both-tier/wisp-aware bead queries for mail visibility; default
  issue-tier `bd list` output and git sync do not include wisp-tier messages.
- Built-in pack auto-include graph traversal now avoids redundant pack reads
  while preserving non-transitive import boundaries and later transitive
  expansion of shallow-seen packs.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- `gc mail inbox`, `gc mail read`, `gc mail peek`, `gc mail thread`,
  and `gc mail count` now accept `--json` and emit schema-versioned result
  envelopes for script and dashboard consumers. `gc mail inbox --json` and
  `gc mail count --json` always include the resolved `recipients` array,
  including single-recipient targets.
- Native `bd` store selection now links the upstream Beads/Dolt Go library
  stack into `gc` when the default beads provider is built. This intentionally
  increases binary size and supply-chain surface through the Dolt/Vitess and
  cloud-provider SDK dependency closure; deployments that do not want that
  path can keep using `GC_BEADS_FORCE_FALLBACK=1` or `GC_BEADS=file`. CI now
  runs `make check-native-dependency-surface` to fail on unreviewed native
  dependency-family growth or `gc` binary-size growth.

### Fixed

- `gc runtime drain-ack` now pokes the city controller socket after setting
  the drain-ack flag, so the reconciler stops and respawns a drained pool
  worker on the current patrol tick instead of waiting up to four ticks
  (~120 s/step → ~30–90 s/step). Closes #2364 (pre-queued work) and #2251
  (cold-pool arrival after drain-ack), which shared the same missing-poke
  root cause.
- `gc --json-schema` manifest output no longer includes the removed
  `transport` field. Consumers should use each role schema's `x-gc-jsonl`
  extension, when present, to determine JSONL record-count behavior.
- `gc session attach` now re-applies `session_live` hooks (status-bar theme,
  keybindings) when it recreates a session whose tmux runtime had exited.
  Previously the resume path in `resolvedWorkerRuntimeWithConfigAndMetadata`
  built the runtime `Hints` without `SessionLive`, so `runSessionLive`
  early-returned on the empty list and attach-recreated sessions came up
  unthemed while reconciler-started sessions did not. The setup context is
  built via the reconciler's own `sessionSetupContextForAgent` so
  `session_live` templates referencing `{{.Rig}}`/`{{.RigRoot}}`/`{{.AgentBase}}`
  expand correctly on the resume path.
- Managed bd provider startup now detects a bd-standalone dolt server running
  against the same `.beads/dolt` database before invoking the managed-bd
  lifecycle script, and refuses with a message naming `bd dolt stop` as the
  unblock. This covers `gc start`, `gc init`, and `gc rig add` provider
  convergence paths. Previously, running `bd dolt start` while a city was
  registered at the same path would leave the standalone dolt holding the
  exclusive write lock; the city-managed dolt could not acquire it and startup
  failed with a generic "dolt server could not start via gc helper" error that
  did not point at the lock holder. Stale `.beads/dolt-server.pid` files and
  live PIDs that do not look like `dolt sql-server` are ignored so leftover
  files and PID reuse do not block startup.
- Default bead-backed pool-demand counts now use the same routed target
  resolution as worker claim queries and exclude epic-routed beads, matching
  the default worker `work_query` behavior. Custom `scale_check` overrides are
  unchanged.
- Empty JSON result collections for `gc mail thread`, `gc trace status`, and
  `gc trace show` now encode as `[]` instead of `null`; `gc trace show` also
  reports a concise no-records message in the default text mode.
- `events.FileRecorder.Record` no longer blocks indefinitely on `flock` when
  a prior `gc event emit` process died holding the lock. Acquisition now
  uses non-blocking `LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB` retried at a 5 ms cadence for up to
  250 ms total, then logs `events: lock: timed out after 250ms waiting on
  flock at <path>` to stderr and returns without recording. The deferred
  `LOCK_UN` still runs after a successful acquire; the happy path and
  non-`EWOULDBLOCK` flock-error path are unchanged. Operators previously
  saw hundreds of stuck `gc event emit` processes after a `SIGKILL` of the
  holder; the new bounded wait drops the stuck event recorder instead of
  stacking processes.
- Kiro provider launch behavior is now explicit in release notes and provider
  docs: the built-in Kiro provider starts `kiro-cli` with `chat`,
  `--no-interactive`, `--agent gascity`, and `--trust-all-tools` by default.
  Operators who do not want unrestricted tool trust can replace the full
  default argv with an explicit `[providers.kiro].args` list in `city.toml`.
- Tmux and runtime provider-overlay staging now surface nonfatal preservation
  warnings on stderr, including the Kiro `AGENTS.md` preservation notice when
  project instructions already exist.
- `jsonl-export.sh` no longer mis-classifies a bead database with an empty
  `issues` table as a failed export. `dolt sql -r json` returns `{}` (not
  `{"rows":[]}`) when a queried table is empty; `validate_exported_issues` now
  treats the bare-object form as zero rows so the database lands in the
  success path with an `issues.jsonl` committed to the archive instead of
  appearing in the `failed:` summary.
- The built-in `control-dispatcher` trace now defaults to
  `${GC_CITY_RUNTIME_DIR}/control-dispatcher-trace.log` (falling back to
  `${GC_CITY}/.gc/runtime/control-dispatcher-trace.log`) instead of writing at
  city root. This keeps workflow-trace appends inside the controller's
  watcher-excluded runtime subtree, avoiding continuous `config-changed`
  reconciliations. After upgrading, operators tailing the default trace should
  switch to `.gc/runtime/control-dispatcher-trace.log`; the old
  `${GC_CITY}/control-dispatcher-trace.log` file becomes stale and can be
  removed. After upgrading, restart or recycle existing `control-dispatcher`
  sessions so they pick up the new trace path; otherwise they keep their
  previous trace target and can continue retriggering reconciles. Validation
  currently covers watcher exclusion, dispatcher warning routing, and the
  graph-workflow integration shard; there is not yet a dedicated patrol-cadence
  stress test.
- `proxy_process` services now receive a `GC_SERVICE_URL_PREFIX` that the
  supervisor's public listener actually routes. Previously the prefix was
  the per-city-relative `/svc/<name>`, so any service that composed
  `CallbackURL = $GC_API_BASE_URL + $GC_SERVICE_URL_PREFIX` (the documented
  shape for adapter self-registration) would 404 on inbound calls. The
  prefix is now the full `/v0/city/<cityName>/svc/<svcName>` path. The
  per-city router contract (`config.Service.MountPathOrDefault`) is
  unchanged.
- `gc session reset` now documents its named-session circuit-breaker behavior:
  when the target is a named session, reset clears a tripped respawn breaker
  before requesting a fresh restart.

### Changed

- `gc converge status --json` returns the convergence metadata object with
  `ok: true` injected. `gc converge list --json` returns an object with
  `ok: true` and `entries`. These converge JSON outputs do not include a
  `schema_version` field.
- `gc runtime drain-check --json` now emits a JSON result when the target
  session is not draining, with `ok: true`, `draining: false`, and the
  existing shell-condition exit code of 1.
- `gc sling --json` now emits one JSONL result record, matching its checked-in
  result schema; earlier JSON support emitted an indented multi-line object.
- `gc trace status` and `gc trace show` now default to human-readable output;
  scripts that need machine-readable trace data should pass `--json`. The
  `--json` result shapes are also envelope objects now: `gc trace status
  --json` uses `active_arms` instead of `arms` and includes
  `schema_version`, `as_of`, `controller_running`, and `controller_pid`;
  `gc trace show --json` returns `schema_version`, `city_path`, `count`, and
  `records` instead of a bare record array. See
  `schemas/trace/status/result.schema.json` and
  `schemas/trace/show/result.schema.json` for the exact contracts.
  During rolling upgrades, trace controller socket status replies include the
  legacy `arms` alias and upgraded CLIs still accept `arms` from older
  controllers.
- Pack import cache validation now requires commit abbreviations in
  `packs.lock` to be at least seven characters long. Shorter abbreviations
  should be refreshed with `gc import install`.
- City discovery now treats a `city.toml` at `$HOME` or an explicit
  `GC_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` entry as a valid city. The ceiling directory is
  searched but never crossed, so existing stray `$HOME/city.toml` files may now
  be discovered from subdirectories where they were previously ignored.
- `gc import migrate` is now a hidden, deprecated guidance shim that exits
  non-zero after pointing operators to `gc doctor` and `gc doctor --fix`.
  Update any scripts that treated `gc import migrate` as a successful
  compatibility migration step.
- `gc rig add --include` now writes canonical `rig.Imports`, which are
  processed alphabetically by binding rather than in legacy declaration order.
- `examples/swarm` now inherits the system-maintenance `dog` agent, so the
  example city has the same fallback agent as other maintenance-enabled
  cities.
- ACP, subprocess, and Kubernetes session staging now apply pack and agent
  overlays through the provider-aware `per-provider/<provider>/` contract.
  Custom ACP overlays that previously expected a literal `per-provider/`
  subtree in the session workdir should move provider-specific files under the
  matching provider slot so they are flattened at launch.
- The review-quorum durable contract now documents that synthesized
  `findings_count` is deduplicated, top-level `mutations_delta` is reserved for
  synthesis-created changes, lane mutation deltas remain under their lane
  records, lane-scoped finalizer failures use
  `lane=<lane_id> reason=<stable_reason>` entries, and unknown lane verdict
  values are hard contract failures. Reviewer lane prompts now require durable
  `lane_id`, `provider`, and `model` fields, and the finalizer rejects blank
  lane IDs without merging contract-invalid lane findings, evidence, or usage
  into the synthesized summary.
- `[[orders.overrides]]` rig matching is stricter and clearer. A rigless
  override (`rig` unset) still matches **only** city-level orders; if the
  named order exists only as per-rig instances, the error now names every
  matching rig so it's obvious what to type. `rig = "*"` is a new wildcard
  that targets every instance of the named order (city-level + per-rig).
  The literal `"*"` is reserved and rejected as a real rig name by config
  validation.
- Managed Dolt config now emits listener backlog and connection-timeout keys.
  Existing managed cities may see a `dolt-config` doctor warning until
  `gc dolt restart` or the next managed server start regenerates
  `dolt-config.yaml`.
- In bead-backed pool reconciliation, `scale_check` output is now documented
  and enforced as additive new-session demand. Assigned work is resumed
  separately; custom checks that previously returned total desired sessions
  should return only new unassigned demand.
- Session bead reconciliation now stops suspended and orphaned runtimes before
  closing their beads; resuming one of those sessions starts a fresh lifecycle
  instead of continuing the previous runtime process.
- `gc hook --inject` is now silent legacy compatibility for already-installed
  Stop/session-end hooks. Fresh managed hook configs no longer install it;
  routed work pickup should happen through the SessionStart claim protocol or
  an explicit non-inject `gc hook` call.
- The built-in Claude provider's `model = "opus"` option now emits
  `claude-opus-4-7`. Cities that rely on the `opus` alias should expect the
  new model target after upgrading.

### Fixed

- Linux systemd supervisor service restarts now preserve managed tmux sessions
  for re-adoption. Linux users should rerun `gc supervisor install` after
  upgrading so the user unit is regenerated with `KillMode=process` and the
  preserve-on-signal environment. If the currently active Linux supervisor
  predates the preserve-on-signal environment, `gc supervisor install` now
  refuses the warm refresh before sending a signal and tells operators to stop
  or drain agents intentionally with `gc supervisor stop --wait`, then rerun the
  install. Once the active supervisor already supports preserve mode, Linux warm
  refresh sends the main supervisor PID `SIGTERM` first so preserve-mode
  shutdown can close workspace services and flush traces, with a bounded
  `SIGKILL` fallback if the process does not exit. The Linux refresh also stops
  orphan-prone workspace service process groups owned by registered cities
  before starting the replacement supervisor; supervisor startup repeats the
  same owned-service cleanup after crashes. Service-managed `SIGTERM` preserves
  sessions for re-adoption, while `SIGINT` remains a destructive escalation
  path. Preserve mode intentionally leaves the beads provider running so
  preserved sessions can keep using the store; the bundled managed-Dolt start
  path is idempotent when it finds an already-running server, but custom exec
  providers must make `start` reattach or no-op safely after preserve-mode
  restarts. macOS launchd upgrades still use launchd unload/load rather than the
  Linux main-PID refresh path; macOS supervisor startup now warns that automatic
  orphaned workspace-service cleanup is Linux-only, lists the registered
  `GC_SERVICE_STATE_ROOT` roots to inspect, and tells operators to stop stale
  workspace-service processes before restarting affected cities after
  non-graceful exits.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-21

First stable release. Between `v0.15.1` and `v1.0.0` the project received 610
commits across 1,273 files (+303,902 / −46,437) from the core team and 12
community contributors. See the GitHub release page for the full narrative.

### Added

- `gc reload [path]` — structured live config reload. Failures keep the previous
  runtime config active instead of silently degrading.
- `gc prime --strict` — turns silent prompt/agent fallback paths into explicit
  CLI failures for debugging.
- `rig adopt` — adopt existing rigs without a full rebuild.
- Provider-native MCP projection for Claude, Codex, and Gemini, with multi-layer
  catalog resolution and projected-only `gc mcp list`.
- Per-agent `append_fragments` so prompt layering is configurable through the
  supported config and migration paths.
- Wave 1 pass over orders and dispatch runtime — store resolution, dispatch
  surfaces, rig-aware execution, and verifier coverage.

### Changed

- **Session model unified.** Declarative `[[agent]]` policy/config is now
  cleanly separated from runtime session identity; session beads are the
  canonical runtime projection.
- **Pack V2 is the active layout.** Bundled packs use `[imports.<name>]`;
  builtin formulas, prompts, hooks, and orders come from the builtin `core`
  pack. V1-era city-local seeding is retired.
- `gc init` is back on the pack-first scaffold contract. Agent and named
  sessions belong in `pack.toml`; machine-local identity stays in
  `.gc/site.toml`; `city.toml` keeps workspace/provider state.
- `gc import install` is now the explicit bootstrap path for importable packs.
- `gc session logs --tail N` returns the last `N` entries (matches Unix `tail`
  convention) instead of the old compaction-oriented behavior.
- Supervisor API migrated to Huma/OpenAPI; Go client regenerated; dashboard SPA
  restored.
- Order "gates" renamed to **triggers**.

### Fixed

- Startup proofs for hook-enabled providers — correct startup prompt delivery,
  no duplicate `SessionStart` hook context, no replay of startup prompts on
  resumed sessions.
- Managed Dolt hardening: recovery, transient failures, health probes,
  runtime-state validation, and late-cycle macOS portability fixes (start-lock
  FD inheritance, path canonicalization, `lsof` reachability, PID confirmation,
  portable `sed` parsing).
- Pack V2 tmux startup regression where large prompt launches could silently
  fall back to the known-broken inline path.
- Custom provider option defaults now fail early instead of silently degrading.
- Beads storage core quality pass — cache recovery, close-all fallback
  semantics, watchdog reconciliation cadence, dirty-cache fallback reads.
- Long tail of session lifecycle, wake-budget, and pool identity fixes.
